#
# REQUIRED FILES TO BUILD THIS IMAGE
# ----------------------------------
# It's necessary the copy a valid cookies file from your Web browser to download Oracle Software from http://www.oracle.com 
# If you don’t already have a tool to export the cookies from the Web browser to a text file, I’d suggest one of the browser extensions below:
#
#    For Firefox: "Export Cookies" (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies/?src=api) 
#    For Chrome: "cookies.txt export" (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookietxt-export/lopabhfecdfhgogdbojmaicoicjekelh)
#
# After installing the extension(s) above on the browser of your choice, follow the steps below:
#
#    Initiate the download of the file you want (if downloading multiple files, you just need to do this for the first one)
#    Once the download is initiated, cancel it.
#    Export the cookies to a file (call it cookies.txt)
#    If you’re using one of the extensions suggested above, this is how you do it:
#
#        On Firefox: click on Tools -> “Export cookies…” and save the file
#        On Chrome: click on the “cookies.txt export” icon in the toolbar (the icon is a blue “C” with an arrow inside), select the entire contents of the cookies and paste it into #	 a text file.
#    Copy the cookies.txt file in the same directory as this Dockerfile.
#
#
# HOW TO BUILD THIS IMAGE
# -----------------------
# Put the cookies.txt file in the same directory as this Dockerfile
# Run: 
#      $ sudo docker build -t oracle/weblogic:12.1.3 .
